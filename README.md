I am learning pytest, and am seeing how pytest can handle various exceptions

In order to learn how to use pytest, follow the following tutorials:
* Complete this video by mcoding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DhUpxWjOhME
* Get started and each How-to guide from https://docs.pytest.org
* You should now be able to complete the basic usage tutorial for tox after some practice from https://tox.wiki/en/latest/example/basic.html#a-simple-tox-ini-default-environments

The MyProject tutorial is my own work. Build your own project, insert an error in your code, and run it with tox and pytest

The only way to get familiar with tox and pytest is to use them yourself.
